# Linux Mint

## It's History
<<<<<<< HEAD
Linux mint is a distribution based on Ubuntu (which in turn is based on Debian).

The linux mint project was strated by a software developer called Clément Lefèbvre (now known as Clem). Clem at the time was writing reviews and tuotorials for various linux websites and decided to start his own linux blog which he called "linux mint" (yes that where the naming came from).

While writing his content, Clem strated gainig an understanding of what the community wants from a distro and so he started the linux mint project in 2006 and its now one of the most popular distros out there. 
=======
Linux Mint was first released in August 2006 and is another operating system used for desktop and laptop computers. It is a fork of [Debian](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/ubuntu-vs-debian-whats-the-difference/) and [Ubuntu](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/ubuntu-vs-fedora-whats-the-difference/),  
and is a very good alternative to the [Ubuntu desktop](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/best-ubuntu-desktop-environments/). Mint is free of cost and open source and, above all, community driven
Mint strives to be a modern, elegant and comfortable operating system that is powerful and easy to use. It is a free and open source operating system. Also, one of the most popular desktop [Linux distributions](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/best-open-source-web-servers/) currently used by millions of people.
#### Why Mint was made ?
because there were some problems in based distro so they fix it and added some packages to Or they edited it for special needs 
#### Problems Like : 
With Ubuntu’s frequent major changes are a double edged sword, tending to push users towards alternatives like Linux Mint.
There is a lack of a stable release schedule, that means, if you’re looking for long term support or bug fixes. Then, you’ll have to pay extra and wait longer than with other distributions.
Non LTS (or interim) versions only include nine months of security support. If you run an older version of Ubuntu and need support from Canonical. Then, you have to upgrade all your packages or wait until an LTS version  release.

- Very stable and low maintenance.
- It's based on Ubuntu which gives the user a large number of available packages (around 30,000).
- It's a very beginner friendly distro.

## It's Cons
| Related TO              | Cons |
| :--------------: | :------: |
|  Stability       | Linux Mint seems like the obvious choice. It’s based on Ubuntu, which provides great stability with software packages and balances that with a hardware enablement stack to give newer computers a fighting chance at working with Linux. |
|  Security        |   The Linux Mint project does not provide security advice and has been criticized for not doing so on at least one occasion.|
|  Performance     | Though Linux Mint may seem a little faster to use daily, but on older hardware, it will feel faster, while Ubuntu seems to work more better as the software ages. Mint becomes even faster when it runs, like Ubuntu. |
|  Compatible apps | Some of the most popular Windows apps that are compatible with Linux Mint include Microsoft Office, Skype, Adobe Photoshop, and iTunes         |
|Hardware/System requirements| 2 GB of RAM , 20 GB of hard drive space , 1024 x 768 resolution|
|Technical support | Does not have support for a large number of popular applications and drivers. If you need these, you should consider other distributions such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint itself.|

## Who is it made for?
<<<<<<< HEAD
``-> Add distros targeted users``
## Who is it **not** made for?
This distro is not made for people who want bleeding edge performance out of their machine or people who are looking for a distro that allows them to have fine grain control over every single detail in order to fully costumize their operating system. 

People who fall in either or both of the above categories usually find other distros such as Arch linux more suitbale for their needs.
=======
-I think that Mint's target user is someone who comes from a windows background.

-Linux Mint does not have background processes that eat up precious system resources!

-Being new to Linux, the transition is going fairly well.

## Who is it **not** made for?
-Gamers

-who don't like Windows look like ever

## What desktop environment does it use?
One of the nice things about linux mint is that it comes in three Editions each with a different desktop environments to suit different needs.

The editions are: Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce.

### Cinnamon
Cinnammon is a desktop envrionment developed by the linux mint team and is based on the GNOME 3 desktop environment.

cinnamon is the most modern and feature rich desktop envrionemnt and also the one that requires the most computing resources.

### MATE
Another version of linux mint uses the MATE desktop environment which is also developed by the linux mint team and is based on the GNOME 2 desktop enviornment.

The mate version has a slower development and has less features than than the cinnamon edition;however, it is less resource intensive than cinnamon.

### Xfce
The last version of linux uses the Xfce dektop environment

The Xfce version does not have as many features as in the cinnamon and MATE versions but it is extremely stabel and very light on resource usage makong it optimal for low spec machines.

## User Experiences/Reviews
- I really love Linux Mint, it is easy to install, very easy to use - yet it also has all the power of Linux under its hood. Just open up a terminal and everything is there. A well thought out and well rounded desktop focused distribution with some really stunning aesthetics.
- Linux Mint is a great alternative for Windows or Ubuntu users, who are looking for a free and genuine operating system, that is both reliable and easy to operate.
- The main features of Linux Mint that made me choose it were: tools for graphic design (GIMP, Blender and Inkscape), improved productivity with LibreOffice suite and access to more than 7 thousand games with Steam.
